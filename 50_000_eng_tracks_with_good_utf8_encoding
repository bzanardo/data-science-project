The Shriek She Made When She Died Was Erased by the Sound of Lightning
He Was Shot by One of Brian’s Children Holding the Cats Hostage in a Cardboard Box
They Watched Him Detonated on the Linoleum Twisting
She Began to Cry Tears of Blood Which Became Little Brick Houses When They Hit the Ground
She Spoke to It Through a Clock Radio in a Dream and Woke as a Cloudburst Obliterating Her Civilization
Eric and Kitty Both Die Within a Month of Each Other, Red Stares at the Coffee Table
Someone Painted a Giant Paperclip on the Sidewalk Right Where You Fell
He Secretly Collected Tragedies Under the Guise of Learning From Past Mistakes and Moving Forward
He Became a Crooked Steeple in a Dusty Old Snow Globe Nobody Had Turned Over in Years
Crazy Painted on Eyebrows Staring Out the Front Window Eating Hot Dog Buns
He Shit Out His Own Skeleton and Wore His Floppy Flesh Like a Trench Coat
